# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub!

I am Thembekile Sharon Magalela, studying Bachelor of IT at the Belgium Campus. However, my journey as a student at BC has been hard, but through the support of the school, family, and friends, I can pull off every challenge. Moreover, facing uncertainties and struggles but I also have the chance to develop resilience, independence, and a strong sense of self.
